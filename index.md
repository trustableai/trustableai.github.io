# A place where early adopters *promote* startups which offer solutions help building Trustable AI.

## About

Trustable AI is a decentralized protocol of gathering with people get involved in the movement of building Trustable AI, also is a decentralized autonomous organization on blockchain. Field of interests is Trust economy after AI becomes a juridical person, "Trustworthy AI", "Explainable AI" and "AI Alignment".

### Our Hypothesis
1. AI will inevitably enter the human economy.
2. the existing economic system (moral, legal natural persons) is based on the modernity of the state's legal rights, which are attached to the rights of individuals. There will be an impact on the basis that the change cannot be covered or explained.
3. governance presumptions, which would impact on the government regulatory regime before the individual.

### Our Problem Awareness
1. What/how will AI intervene in the human economy?
2. What is the current status of the rights debate/what are the issues of debate?
3. What are the change scenarios if AI enter the human economic system?
4. Within or outside the scope of existing regulatory mechanisms or governance systems?

## Token economy
Under development.

## FAQ

### What is different between "Trustable AI" and "Trustworthy AI"?
Trustable implies able to be trusted, and trustworthy implies worthy of trust. Being trustable doesn't necessarily imply trustworthy, and vice versa. The
Machines are not trustworthy; only humans can be trustworthy (or untrustworthy). 

Trustable AI is more about to create a compensation mechanisms for AI consumer victimization. and Trustworthy AI" is more focus on ethical consideration and public interest.

### What is AI?
To be practical and down to the ground, We simply think AI are a self-learnable algorithms, no matter it is machine learning, deep learning or other fancy algorithms in the future.

Due to the autonomous nature of AI, and the fact that AI users, AI developers together, with or without purpose, influence the behavior of AI, It is difficult to treat AI as a product in civil law simply. In order to deal with contractual and tort liability, it is necessary to develop a new form of distributed liability for risk diversification purposes.

In the consideration of AI should be a "distributed agency", we propose that each AI is a "decentralized autonomous organization" with specialized deposits for reinsurance liability, in charge of manage deployment (and undeployment) of risk-indeterminable algorithms.

### What is Decentralized Autonomous Organization?

According [Wikipidia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization), "A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), sometimes labeled a decentralized autonomous corporation (DAC), is an organization represented by rules encoded as a computer program that is transparent, controlled by the organization members and not influenced by a central government."
